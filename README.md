Task -4 : ONLINE EXAMINATION
I have completed Task-4 (Online Examination) in Java Programming.

I have tried to make this OnlineExamination a little bit different by adding GUI and AWT to the Program.
This program starts by taking Login details of the Student, like the Roll no and Password.
If the login details are correct then it will take you to next Frame, In the left side you will see your profile
like name, branch, gender, roll no, password. You can update profile and change password.
And in the right side you will have 3 buttons
1.Take test
2.check marks
3.logout
If you choose to take test the online, the Exam will be started, you need to give correct answers to the asked questions
out of 5 questions.
After attempting all questions click submit button, you will see the marks you obtained.
After completing online test click on logout, you will be logged out successfully.
